    <p>HEDDA.

        Yes, I have. I want for once in my life to have power to mould a human
        destiny.

        
        MRS. ELVSTED.
        
        Have you not the power?
        
        
        HEDDA.
        
        I have not--and have never had it.
        
        
        MRS. ELVSTED.
        
        Not your husband's?
        
        
        HEDDA.
        
        Do you think that is worth the trouble? Oh, if you could only understand
        how poor I am. And fate has made you so rich! [Clasps her passionately
        in her arms.] I think I must burn your hair off after all.
        
        
        MRS. ELVSTED.
        
        Let me go! Let me go! I am afraid of you, Hedda!
        
        
        BERTA.
        
        [In the middle doorway.] Tea is laid in the dining-room, ma'am.
